# Platform No.5 Website

This project is my (Denish Shrestha's) submission for my Year 11 2025 Interactive Media and UX Design Assessment Task (Term 1)

## Features
- Eight pages advertising/promoting the small cafe 'Platform No.5' in Glenfield.
- Image slideshows
- More to be added as the project is completed

## Information on the business
Platform No.5 is a small cafe near the Glenfield Train station (hence the name) which has been there for a very long time. I chose this business because they have taken many images of their cafe, food, staff and aesthetics over the years which made it easier to complete this assessment task.
